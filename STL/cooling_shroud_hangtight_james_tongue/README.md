# Summary

A Beta part cooling duct for the Railcore 300ZL utilising a 5015 blower and proven nozzle geometry.

The adapter plate has a slot for a captive M3 nut, and the duct will require an insert/ helicoil for the blower retention bolt.

A duct version and adapter plate for the aluminium carriage plate added.

Both ducts revised to give an extra 2mm of height clearance. Spacers/shims added, and the F3d files are there for the adapters and shims.
