# Summary

These are the printed components that pair with the Aluminum Idler plate for the RailCore II, available from 713maker.com

To attach the belt retainer clip you need (4) m3 x 8mm flat head bolts and (1) m3 x 6mm button head bolt.  The printed belt retainer also requires you install (5) M3 brass inserts.

Some parts are not 100% compatible with the aluminum Y carriage, those are also included here in a modified format.  They are the Bondtech BMG mount, and the fan mount.  (Only an angled fan mount is currently modeled)

I strongly recommend this fan mount over the angled one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3367622

It is recommended you print all of these in CF PETG, ABS, or similar filament.
