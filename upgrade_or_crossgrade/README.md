# Upgrade or Crossgrade Parts

This repo is for official parts that aren't necessary for a base RailCore functionality.

They may add functionality or improve appearance or provide different functionality from the base RailCore design, but are not necessary in any sense for building a RailCore. 


### Coupler Cover
This is a part designed to drop over the couplers to protect them from random detritus and tools - you know, the cruft in the bottom of your printer - from interfering or getting caught in your spinning Z couplers.
